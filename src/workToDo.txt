	logs for loaner 
	
	part checkin
	
	reconize serial numbers in intake form
	
	loaner form
		jk it is now a modal... 
			need to add a selector for condition, loaded from when last checked in
			text box for estimated value, also loaded from database
				when it does not reconize the computer:
					Make and Model
					Serial Number
					
	make it not die when disconnected from K drive
	loaner checkin
	attention items (for example if a repair is open for more than 2 months unfinished, or 2 month after finishing)
	better error messages when config or backend dies, or if the k drive is down
	does every loaner connect to a repair... If so, why do we have so many loaners out?
	
		
	easter eggs:
		when clicking on "Repa" it changes a random nice color and then goes back to what it was
		when writing a @umich.edu email it says "muck fishican"
	

	late game:
		add colors for logged in

	
	when adding a new work thing:
		add 2 css variables
		add 2 css classes
		add config color
		add load config into css in index.js
	
	
	
cons:
	every new employee has to be added (using brennans configurator)
	every new repair product we decide to support needs to be added
	potential for new bugs
	changes to our current system
	loaners not complete
	will have to be updated often

expected and here:
	multiple people can use it at once
	can store and retreieve repairs
	can print forms for people to sign

pros:
	conneciton to OSU find people to validate emails and students
	iPad serial number requirement
	applecare+ fee and find my notifications
	configurable 
	commited to documentation (not much yet)
	repair journal (can see everything that happens)
	work is done with events and not in one big text box
	runs on the same infrustucure that access does
	has highlighting on first signiture line
	looks prettier
	pokemon
	front colorful and has status labels
	
	
big pros:
	can handle 100,000 repairs easily, wont slow down
	does not freeze (has indications when doing work)
